            <p>
              The reason I chose computer science is because I wanted to create
              cool stuff. Making personal projects is a way I have to make cool
              stuff. I had the idea of making a portfolio website after
              attending a presentation at my university about making personal
              projects, in which a website was the two presenters' common
              project. I chose it as my first project in computer science after
              a lot of deabte, as it's a classic computer science project, and
              opens an area for me to showcase my future projects. As such, on
              April 3rd 2025, I started working on this project.
            </p>

            <p>
              My first priority was to make a bunch of design decisions. As
              someone who had zero web development experience, I was immediately
              intimidated by the amount of different options I was presented
              with for everything. I settled on writing everything from scratch
              using HTML/CSS, as this way, I can focus on the very fundamentals
              I needed work on. I chose to host the final website on GitHub
              Pages, as it was free for me and on a platform I was already
              using, and had all the features I needed.
            </p>
            <p>
              After that, I started making a project plan. My initial plan
              included a home page that mostly featured the latest highlights,
              an about section with a more detailed view of who I am, a Blog
              section where I would post updates that aren't related to computer
              science, a Project section that would eventually become an
              Experience section where I would post updates that are related to
              Computer Science and professional development as a whole, and a
              Contact Page, so that anyone can contact me. I also put in a lot
              of very ambitious ideas, such as an entire system to post new
              blog/project posts, a chibi character that runs around while
              you're on the website, and a background video that I would edit
              onto the home page that would look super cinematic. Most of those
              got scrapped from the initial release, but may be featured when I
              get the motivation/experience needed to work on my website 2.0
            </p>
            <p>
              The choice to make it a pixel art theme came pretty early on. I am
              personally a big fan of pixel art, as I find a certain charm to
              it. It's a situation similar to how people love
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointillism"
                >Pointillism</a
              >
              art. It would also give my website a more personal style, as pixel
              art is not a theme I saw on many portfolio websites. It might also
              have been
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#Fallacy_effect"
                >sunk-cost fallacy</a
              >
              getting to me, as I had purchased a
              <a href="https://www.aseprite.org/">pixel art software</a> two
              weeks before I began this project and never used it.

            <p>
              After that, I started learning. I spent 2 days watching HTML/CSS
              tutorials on youtube before I realized it was a bit of a waste of
              time past the first 3 hours and decided to take a more hands on
              approach. During that time, I set up my IDE (<a
                href="https://code.visualstudio.com/"
                >Visual Studio Code</a
              >) for web development and learned that I didn't need to learn
              much JavaScript to accomplish 90% of the goals I set for myself
              for my website, which was a bit of a relief.
            </p>

            <p>
              Progress went by pretty quick at first. Within the first week, I
              wrote HTML skeletons for the home page and about page, and had
              made some very nice looking styling. I also started searching for
              the fonts that I would use in the website, and eventually settled
              on three:
              <a href="https://www.dafont.com/connection-ii.font"
                >Connection II</a
              >, which resembles the minecraft font a lot,
              <a href="https://www.dafont.com/osxdarwin.font">OS X Darwin</a>,
              which ressembles more what you find on a more classic arcade, and
              <a href="https://www.dafont.com/joystix.font">Joystix</a>, which
              also ressembled an arcade font, but gave different vibes. Although
              they ended up swapping a bunch, I decided to use Joystix for major
              titles, OS X Darwin for non-title text that were still kinda
              important, and Connection II for general text.
            </p>
            <p>
              Soon however, progress started slowing down. There were two major
              reasons for that. First, I chose my timing extremely poorly as I
              had started this project right before final exam season, so I had
              to shift my focus onto my exams, and focus on moving out
              afterwards, as I was living in university residences. Second, I
              got stuck with a lot of artistic decisions such as choosing color
              schemes, picking how to place images and balancing all the
              artistic decisions with my capabilities as a web developper.
              Therefore, during the second half of April, I made very little
              progress on this website
            </p>
            <p>
              Eventually however, all of those were over, but by then, a month
              had passed since I started this project. During that month, I got
              other smaller project ideas I wanted to work on, other concepts
              and tools I wanted to learn, which ultimately sapped my motivation
              of remaining on this project. This is around when I decided to
              scrap pretty much all my most ambitious ideas and shelve them for
              a later date, and why this project is titled "Personal Website
              1.0". With a much smaller scope, I worked on finishing the last
              details before I would release my website officially. I drew the
              contact icons in my pixel art software to add them at the bottom
              in the contact area, I finished the entirety of the About section
              and most of the homepage, and I properly reformatted my file
              structures to make them easier to modify in the future.
            </p>

            <p>
              And with that, and a long time styling, trying and rejecting
              designs, and struggling with thematic decisions, I released the
              website to the world, which is where you're reading this text
              right now!
            </p>
            <p>
              The version I released on May 9th was definitely not fully
              polished. Some of the colors could've been chosen better, and a
              lot of the formatting break on mobile or other screen sizes.
              However, I'm releasing it now to officially stop making it my main
              focus, as I want to get started with other project ideas. I will
              still update it slowly in the future, though. Eventually, I also
              want to remake this website, which will probably be website
              version 2.0, using more framework and Javascript once I get more
              experienced with more concepts.
            </p>
            <p>
              I hope you enjoyed reading through my journey of making this
              website!
